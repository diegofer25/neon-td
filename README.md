### Key Design Patterns

- **Object Pooling**: Reduces garbage collection for frequently created/destroyed objects
- **System Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dedicated managers
- **Configuration-Driven**: Centralized balance and settings management
- **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling between systems through callbacks

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

Game balance and settings are centralized in `GameConfig.js`. Key configurable areas:

### Wave Scaling
```javascript
WAVE: {
    BASE_ENEMY_COUNT: 4,          // Enemies in wave 1
    ENEMY_COUNT_SCALING: 2,       // Additional enemies per wave
    SCALING_FACTORS: {
        HEALTH: 1.15,             // 15% health increase per wave
        SPEED: 1.1,               // 10% speed increase per wave
        DAMAGE: 1.15              // 15% damage increase per wave
    }
}
```

### Power-Up Pricing
```javascript
POWERUP_PRICES: {
    "Damage Boost": 15,
    "Triple Shot": 40,
    "Explosive Shots": 60,
    // ... see GameConfig.js for full list
}
```

### Performance Tuning
```javascript
VFX: {
    PARTICLE_LIMITS: {
        MAX_PARTICLES: 200,       // Maximum active particles
        MAX_PROJECTILES: 100      // Maximum active projectiles
    }
}
```

### Adding New Power-Ups

1. **Define the power-up** in `PowerUp.js`:
```javascript
new PowerUp(
    "My Power-Up",
    "Description of effect",
    "üéØ",
    (player) => { /* Apply effect */ },
    true // Stackable
)
```

2. **Add pricing** in `GameConfig.js`:
```javascript
POWERUP_PRICES: {
    "My Power-Up": 25
}
```

3. **Add to shop category** in `Shop.js` or `PowerUp.js`:
```javascript
CATEGORIES: {
    OFFENSE: [..., "My Power-Up"]
}
```

### Performance Debugging

Add `?stats=true` to the URL to enable performance monitoring:
```
http://localhost:8080/?stats=true
```

This displays real-time FPS, frame time, and optimization status.

### Balancing Guidelines

- **Wave Scaling**: Enemy stats should scale exponentially but be capped to prevent infinite growth
- **Power-Up Pricing**: Use stacking multipliers to encourage build diversity
- **Performance**: Keep particle counts under 200 for smooth gameplay on lower-end devices
- **Difficulty**: Each wave should feel challenging but achievable with proper upgrades

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Code Style
- Use JSDoc comments for all functions
- Follow the existing modular architecture
- Add configuration options to `GameConfig.js` instead of hardcoding values
- Write performance-conscious code (prefer object pooling for frequently created objects)

## üêõ Known Issues

- Audio may not autoplay in some browsers due to autoplay policies
- Performance may degrade on very old mobile devices (pre-2018)
- High DPI scaling may cause slight blurriness on some displays
